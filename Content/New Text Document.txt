Education Sector in Bangladesh

Bangladesh has made laudable progress in expanding access to education and improving educational attainment rates since the country’s independence in 1971. The net enrolment rate in primary education reached 98 percent in 2018, according to the Government of Bangladesh’s 2019 Annual Sector Performance Report.  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics figures indicate the adult literacy rate increased from 46 percent in 2001 to 73 percent in 2018.

Bangladesh’s tertiary education is made up of three systems:  Universities/Colleges and vocational education/trade schools. Enrolment rates for tertiary education doubled over the past decade, they remained at 20.57 percent in 2018, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics.

Total size of student population is around 29 million (20% of total population)
Percentage of primary school going students is 55.95% (17 million)
Percentage of secondary school going students is 25.5% (7.4 million)
Approx 2.5% of students go to public colleges/universities (around 720,000)
Approx 16% of students go to private colleges/universities (4.6 million)
Around 0.05% (15,000) students go overseas to study each year.  

Bangladesh A Good Quality Higher Education Hub

Good quality education doesn’t need to be expensive – be it primary, secondary or tertiary sector. Bangladesh has proven this time and again. 

More than 30 million students are currently pursuing education in Bangladesh, including 4.6 million in universities, colleges, medical colleges and higher educational institutions – at the lowest possible cost, especially in the public universities and colleges.

There was a time when Bangladeshi students used to line-up at foreign embassies for student visas to study abroad – a number has been growing steadily. However, a new trend that saw international students enrolling in Bangladesh’s growing number of higher colleges and universities – has been steadily growing that, if continues, will transform Bangladesh a regional education hub in the coming years.

Bangladesh now has 163 universities, including 55 public and 108 private universities, many of them specialised in engineering, science, technology, medical and agricultural studies and research and 115 highly-competitive medical colleges, where international students pursue higher studies at a fraction of the cost of higher studies in other countries. 

Bangladesh offers a cost-effective solution to higher studies, something that is attracting foreign students to this South Asian country.

An Indian student usually spends around US$100,000 to earn an MBBS degree in India, which they can achieve with the same quality for around US$40,000. This is encouraging more and more students from Asian and African countries to enrol for higher studies in Bangladesh.

As a result, Bangladesh is emerging as an alternative destination for good-quality and low-cost higher education for international students. Bangladesh has more than 20 good medical colleges for the international students to choose from.

Bangladesh Education Forum 2022 exhibition-cum-conference will highlight the strength of the educational institutions in Bangladesh and their ability to offer good-quality affordable education to international students.

Currently 3.2 million students are enrolled in tertiary level education. The total tertiary enrolment may exceed 4.6 million by 2026, according to an estimate made by the University Grants Commission (UGC) of Bangladesh, the higher education supervision and regulatory body.

Bangladesh has 55 well-established public universities, fully funded by the government while managed as self-governed organisations.

Studying in Bangladesh enables international students obtain better-paid job opportunities anywhere in the world. Compared to other international educational destinations, Bangladesh offers more affordable Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees including CSE, BBA, MBA, etc.

Depending on where a student is coming from, studying in Bangladesh can be closer to one’s home country, so one will not have to spend a lot on travelling, and it can be easier to visit family and friends during holidays. Besides, the hospitable environment and plenty of socialising options make it interesting to study in Bangladesh.

In most cases, universities in Bangladesh offering degrees in English are accredited by Bangladesh Government and can be fully or partially accredited by universities in other countries. 

So, because they’ll be studying an international degree, the students will have better chances at continuing your studies abroad, in more popular study destinations and prestigious universities from Europe, the U.S., Canada, or Australia.

English-taught studies in Bangladesh are also a great chance to build a professional network that is a great source of opportunities and potential collaboration after graduation.

Medical Universities and Colleges

At present, there are 115 accredited medical colleges in Bangladesh, 37 of which are public and 72 are private medical colleges. Apart from these, six medical colleges are run by the Bangladesh Armed Forces under the Ministry of Defence. 

The Government of Bangladesh is committed to upgrade the entire healthcare system of the country including medical education. The government has encouraged capable private authorities to set up multiple private colleges alongside its own institutions. 

Till 1990, there were mostly public medical colleges offering MBBS, BDS and MS degrees. However, the next decade witnessed a significant increase in the number of medical colleges after the entry of the private corporate houses who developed high-end study centres for the aspiring doctors. 

After three decades, Bangladeshi medical colleges now compete with any renowned institutes worldwide.

Every year, thousands of students from India, Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan, Maldives, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, China, Russia and some African countries enroll in medical colleges and medical universities for MBBS studies. 

As many as 200 seats are reserved for foreign medical students in the highly competitive public medical colleges institutions that offer high quality affordable education. Around 45 percent seats are open for foreign students in the private medical colleges.

While Indian students move mountains to get a medical degree from foreign countries, most of them fail to get through the Foreign Medical Graduate Exam (FEME) — a screening test that offers the license to practice in India. From 2015–2018, the total pass percentage of the exam was 14.22 percent, with only 8,731 out of 61,418 candidates who appeared in the past four years managed to pass the exam. Despite such tough scrutiny, students from Bangladesh happen to have the highest pass percentage amongst all other countries  —  with 27.11 percent!

Standard quality of education and lower financial burden are the two main reasons, why most students prefer Bangladesh for medical education. At present, more than 7,000 Indian students are pursuing MBBS studies in medical colleges in Bangladesh, at a rate of 1,250 enrolment per year and the number is growing.

Bangladesh offers cost effective medical education – MBBS Degree – to International students in leading MIC recognised medical colleges abroad making it one of the most popular destinations for medical education.

Why Study in Bangladesh?

Bangladesh is slowly becoming an important education destination for students from countries like Nepal, Bhutan, African countries, Middle east etc. for getting their undergraduate degree for a number of reasons. 

First, the lower cost of higher education is a key as Bangladesh offers the most cost-effective quality higher education in the world. 

Every year, a large number of international students apply to the top universities in Bangladesh. The cost of living and education here is quite affordable compared to other universities around the world.

Secondly, Bangladesh has a world-renowned education system, top-class universities and a reputation for producing creative thinkers. That's why more than 50,000 students from over 180 different countries choose to study in Bangladesh every year.

Thirdly, with lowest cost of living, international students can live at the lowest cost with three meals a day. 

A bachelor's degree is a post-secondary degree awarded after completed 120 credits. It usually takes eight semesters to complete a Bachelor's degree. While completing an undergraduate course, candidates have to study general courses and chose a primary specific subject. 

Almost all universities in Bangladesh offers bachelor degree for international students at an affordable cost. At Bangladesh Education Forum 2022, international students can get admission to the universities for under-graduate and graduate studies.

When higher education is becoming a necessity due to the increased need for highly qualified professionals and the cost of attending university increases faster, Bangladesh is the only top study destination whose universities' tuition fees are low.

Thanks to their recognised teaching and research excellence, they enjoy this worldwide reputation and build upon a long and rich higher education tradition. In addition to the globally ranked universities, several other Bangladeshi universities are introduced in global rankings every year. Besides being among the best, some Bangladeshi universities are also the oldest in Asia.
