Bangladesh Education Forum 2022 exhibition-cum-conference
will highlight the strength of the educational institutions in Bangladesh and
their ability to offer good-quality affordable education to international
students. Currently, 3.2 million students are enrolled in tertiary-level
education. The total tertiary enrolment may exceed 4.6 million by 2026,
according to an estimate made by the University Grants Commission (UGC) of Bangladesh,
the higher education supervision and regulatory body.


Bangladesh has 55 well-established
public universities, fully funded by the government, while managed as self-governed
organizations. Studying in Bangladesh enables international students to obtain
better-paid job opportunities anywhere in the world.
